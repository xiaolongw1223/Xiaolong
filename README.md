Hello, my name is Xiaolong Wei and I am pursuing my Ph.D. degree in geophysics, in [Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences](https://uh.edu/nsm/earth-atmospheric/) at [University of Houston](https://www.uh.edu/). My research interests resolve around the theme of inverse modeling for various subsurface systems.


- 🔭 I'm currently working on joint inversion and uncertainty analysis using potential field and petrophysical data, primarily applied to critical mineral exploration
- 👯 I’m currently collaboratively working on Antarctic geophysical imaging
- 🌱 I’m currently learning electromagnetic geophysics and machine/deep learning
- 💬 Ask me about joint inversion and inverse theory
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with 3D Bayesian inversion, especially using unstructure mesh
